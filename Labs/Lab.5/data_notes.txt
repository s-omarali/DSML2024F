Different Types of attacks:

Normal Connection
b'normal.': This label indicates a normal network connection with no malicious activity.

Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks
Denial-of-Service attacks aim to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with a flood of illegitimate requests.

b'neptune.': A DoS attack using SYN flood.
b'smurf.': A DoS attack using ICMP echo requests to flood a target.
b'back.': A DoS attack against a web server.
b'teardrop.': A DoS attack that exploits overlapping IP fragments.
b'pod.': A DoS attack known as "Ping of Death" that sends malformed or oversized packets to a target.

Probing (Probe) Attacks
Probing attacks involve surveillance and other probing activities to gather information about a network or system.

b'portsweep.': A probing attack that scans multiple ports on a single host to find open ports.
b'ipsweep.': A probing attack that scans multiple IP addresses to find active hosts.
b'nmap.': A probing attack using the Nmap tool to scan for open ports and services.


Remote-to-Local (R2L) Attacks
Remote-to-Local attacks involve unauthorized access from a remote machine to a local machine.

b'warezclient.': An R2L attack involving unauthorized access to a system to download pirated software.
b'warezmaster.': An R2L attack involving unauthorized access to a system to upload pirated software.
User-to-Root (U2R) Attacks
User-to-Root attacks involve unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges.

b'satan.': A U2R attack using the SATAN tool to find vulnerabilities in a network.
